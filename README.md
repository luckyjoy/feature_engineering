# **Feature Engineering for Supervised Classification Models**

In this notebook, we will learn how to perform feature engineering on a dataset using Python to prepare it for modeling with a supervised classification model. All the code and related instructions are included in this notebook.

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset we’ll be working with contains customer data from a European bank. This data will be revisited throughout the course as we compare the performance of different models. To get the most out of this activity, review the data dictionary to familiarize yourself with the dataset.

The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a bank customer will churn—i.e., leave the bank and take their business elsewhere. Predicting customer churn allows the bank to take proactive measures to retain customers at risk of leaving.

### Topics Covered in This Activity:
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for the model.
- **Removing Uninformative Features**: Eliminating features that don’t provide valuable information.
- **Feature Extraction**: Creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
- **Feature Transformation**: Modifying features to better align with the modeling objectives.
- **Encoding Categorical Features**: Converting categorical variables into dummy variables for modeling.
